/*So what sorts of traits are characteristic of higher reading levels? Well, longer words probably correlate with higher reading
 levels. Likewise, longer sentences probably correlate with higher reading levels, too.

A number of “readability tests” have been developed over the years that define formulas for computing the reading level of a text. 
One such readability test is the Coleman-Liau index. The Coleman-Liau index of a text is designed to output that (U.S.) grade 
level that is needed to understand some text. The formula is

index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8
where L is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text, and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words in
 the text.*/
