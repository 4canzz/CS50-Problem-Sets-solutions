"This only includes the answers, not the analysis or full explanation. It's recommended to first analyze the algorithms yourself
by using the time command line tool. Use it to measure how long each algorithm takes as the number of numbers increases in each
file. Then, compare the results with the corresponding Big O and Big Omega notations.

sort1 uses: bubble

How do you know?: by estimating and graphing by using time command. Big Omega shows to be roughly n.

sort2 uses: merge

How do you know?: by estimating and graphing using time command. Big Omega shows to be roughly n*log(n).

sort3 uses: selection

How do you know?: by estimating and graphing using time command. Big Omega shows to be roughly n^2.
